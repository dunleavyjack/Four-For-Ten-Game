# "Four For Ten"

A 2D Pixel Art game written in Python.

This project was a collaboration with designer **Jeonghye Yoon**, who created the images and established the overall feel of the game!

In South Korea, there is a well-known deal at almost every convenience store colloquially known as the "Four For Ten". The deal is simple, four beers for 10k Korean won. But, not every beer is included in the deal.

You play as a character collecting the deal-inclusive beers as they pass by in a traditional scrolling style while being careful to avoid those without the discount. Collect four of them and win.

A friend of mine is a Python developer and his birthday was coming, so I thought I could make the game as a gift. So, the user plays as a 2D rendered version of my friend's head.
